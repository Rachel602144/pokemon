this project focuses on classifying pokemon as either a mega evolution pokemon or a regular pokemon using machine learning. the dataset includedes 721 pokemons with attributes such as name, HP, attack, defense, speed, special attack,special defense and total, along with categorical features like Type 1 and Type 2. data preprocessing is then done which involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables to convert then into binary, and splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. a logistic regression model is then trained to predict the mega evolution status. the model is then evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve to analyze its performance.
