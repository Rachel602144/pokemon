this project focuses on classifying Pok√©mon as either Mega Evolution or Regular using machine learning. the dataset includedes 721 pokemons with attributes such as name, HP, attack, defense, speed, special attack,special defense and total, along with categorical features like Type 1 and Type 2. data preprocessing is then done which involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables, and splitting the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. a logistic regression model is then trained to predict the Mega Evolution status. the model is then evaluated using accuracy score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve to analyze its performance.
